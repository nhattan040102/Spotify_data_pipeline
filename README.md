# Project Title: Spotify Data Pipeline (ETL) Project Using Python

## Project Description:


In this project, we build a comprehensive data pipeline that efficiently handles Spotify API data using Azure suite of services and Python programming.

## Tech stacks:
* **Airflow**: Apache Airflow played a pivotal role in orchestrating and
automating the ETL Extract, Transform, Load) processes, ensuring data
was efficiently retrieved, transformed, and loaded into MongoDB.

* **MongoDB**: served as the project's database solution, providing
a flexible and scalable storage system for housing the structured Spotify
data, making it readily accessible for analysis and reporting.

* **Spotify API**: served as the primary source for retrieving user streaming
data, which was then processed for analysis and visualization within the ETL data pipeline.
